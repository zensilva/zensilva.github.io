          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Greetings and welcome! My name is Zen, I am a passionate 
            programmer and sound engineer. With over a decade of experience in the
             tech industry, I have honed my skills and expertise in programming 
            languages such as Python and Java, as well as exploring my creativity through 
            music production.
          </p>
          <p>Some work I have done in the tech industry ranges from helping start up companies with consulting, setting up their platform, white paper, and managing the security within their website.
            All of the clients I have helped solve their problem were all retail customers and or small and local establishments.
          </p>
          <p>   
            Furthermore, my experience from collaborating with other musicians has taught me
             the importance of effective communication and teamwork. As an artist, I
             specialize in crafting lofi hip hop and downtempo EDM beats that 
            transport listeners to a world of tranquility and bliss.</p>
          <p>My ultimate goal as a programmer is to provide the best 
            service possible to my clients. Whether it means putting in extra hours,
             researching new technologies, or striving for excellence in every 
            project, I am committed to going above and beyond to exceed 
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, I genuinely look forward to the opportunity to work with you.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Zen has a passion for technology and has developed a wide range of skills through self-study and 
         hands-on experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school, Zen successfully bypassed his highschool's 
         firewall in order to download and play Zelda in class, demonstrating an 
         early aptitude for computer security. Zen also experimented with malware
          and the way viruses were created, gaining valuable insights into how 
         computer systems can be compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
         More recently, Zen has been pursuing a degree in Cyber 
         Security/ Computer Science, learning programming languages such as 
         Python, Java, SQL, C++, and building projects such as password 
         generators and vaults, Youtube scraper, SHA256 converter, Leveraged 
         liquidation level indicator, and a couple more small projects like a 
         text game. They have also gained experience working on freelance 
         projects for clients in both computer science and audio engineering.
        </p>
        <p>  
         Outside of work and school, Zen enjoys pursuing their passion 
         for music, which has helped them develop a strong sense of creativity 
         and attention to detail. This has proven to be a valuable asset in their
          work as a programmer, as they are able to approach problems from unique
          perspectives and find innovative solutions.

      <section id="MyTube">
        <h2>MyTube: Youtube scraper</h2>
        <p>MyTube is a personal project of mine as well as a friendly service where you are able to submit get requests for YouTube videos, songs, or playlists.</p>
        <p>This is a program that I will be using in order to help people save money and to build a small community of pirates and DJs to act as a decentralized autonymous online organization. (dj'ing popular music, watching your favorite channels without ads, have more control over with your media files and bypassing the mobile lock screens pausing playback when you lock your phone)        <p>
        </p>
        <p>With this service you will be able to access my youtube scraper and pull as much data as your local machines can store. The current service that I offer is within my discord server. I have DJ's, pirates, and automation lovers a #request files channel where they can submit their URL's as well as a #audio and #video for the files to be accessed and download what was requested.
        </p>
        <p> >> If downloading bulk or > 25, please create a burner playlist set to PUBLIC! share the playlist and submit URL of the playlist. This process is labor intensive and I would like to make it as seamless as possible for my beta users until the website is live. <<
